# DMForge Backlog

- ✅ Rate limiting — sliding-window limiter (`lib/rateLimit.js`) wired into `handleRoute` in the catch-all API route: 60 req/min per uid, 20 req/min per IP for unauthenticated requests, 429 `{ error: "rate_limit_exceeded" }` on breach.
- ✅ Zapier / webhook outbound — `users/{uid}/webhooks` CRUD (`POST`/`GET /api/webhooks`, `DELETE /api/webhooks/:id`) + `triggerWebhooks()` in `lib/webhooks.js`, fired (fire-and-forget, HMAC-SHA256 signed) from `/result/save` when `state.booked` is true.
- ✅ Follow-up sequence builder — "campaign" mapped to the existing `agents` collection (no separate campaign model exists). `agents/{id}/sequences` + Gemini-generated Day 1/3/7 sequence (`POST/GET /api/agents/:id/sequences[/generate]`, `PUT .../sequences/:seqId`), inline expandable panel + edit on the dashboard agent cards.
- ✅ Inbox view — BUILT (2026-07-06). `leads/{uid}/prospects/{id}` model with denormalized `latestReply`/`latestReplyAt`/`lastMessageAt`/`status` + a `messages` subcollection thread. Full CRUD (`POST/GET /api/prospects`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/prospects/:id`, `POST /api/prospects/:id/messages`) and a token-scoped public **reply-ingestion pipeline** (`POST /api/inbound/token` mints the URL, `POST /api/inbound/:token` matches-or-creates a prospect from any channel poller/Zapier/email parser). `/inbox` UI: status-filtered list, thread drawer, outbound logging, status transitions. A transition into `booked` now **auto-fires** the reminder + GHL-sync + webhook side effects (`lib/prospects.js onProspectBooked`) — closing the auto-trigger gap that tasks 8/10 flagged.
- ✅ Email outreach channel — `users/{uid}/channels/email` (Gmail-via-SMTP or generic SMTP), AES-256-GCM creds at rest (`lib/encryption.js`, needs `ENCRYPTION_KEY` — not yet set in Vercel), connection tested before saving, `/settings/channels` UI. `/api/outreach/send` dedups by content hash under `users/{uid}/sentMessages` (the spec's `leads/{uid}/prospects/{id}/sentMessages` path doesn't exist — no lead model — flagged, not faked). Gmail is SMTP+app-password, not 3-legged OAuth (no GMAIL_CLIENT_ID/SECRET registered).
- ✅ LinkedIn OAuth connect — 3-legged OAuth (`GET /api/auth/linkedin` → consent URL with encrypted-state-carried uid, `GET /api/auth/linkedin/callback` → token exchange + profile fetch, encrypted token in `users/{uid}/channels/linkedin`), `POST /api/outreach/linkedin/send`, Connect/Disconnect card on `/settings/channels`. Reuses `lib/encryption.js` + channel pattern. NEEDS `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/REDIRECT_URI` (returns 503 until set) — requires a registered LinkedIn app.
- ✅ Team / agency seats — `users/{uid}` gains `role`/`agencyId` (additive, no query breakage), `agencies/{ownerUid}` = `{ ownerUid, seats, memberUids[] }`. `POST /api/agency/invite` (Agency-plan gated, creates agency on first invite), `GET /api/agency/accept?token=` (transactional seat check), `POST /api/agency/remove`, `GET /api/agency`, Settings → Team page. Seat limit from Stripe `subscription.metadata.seats` (fallback 10). NOTE: invite link is returned/copied to clipboard — no system transactional email provider exists, so no email is auto-sent (flagged in code).
- ✅ SMS appointment reminders — `users/{uid}/channels/sms` (Twilio, encrypted), `lib/sms.js` (fetch wrapper, not the heavy SDK — one endpoint), `POST /api/reminders/schedule` enqueues 24h+1h reminders to `reminders/{uid}/pending` (skips past-due), `GET /api/cron/send-reminders` (Vercel cron `*/15`, `vercel.json`) fires overdue with a transactional double-send guard. SMS card on `/settings/channels`. FLAGGED: cron + optional `CRON_SECRET` are deployment changes; auto-firing on a "booked" transition needs a lead phone + `scheduledAt` the demo flow doesn't capture, so `/reminders/schedule` is the explicit primitive instead.
- ✅ White-label mode — `agencies/{id}.whiteLabel` = `{ brandName, primaryColor, logoUrl?, domain?, hideParentBranding }`, `PUT /api/agency/white-label` (Agency-plan owner only, hex-validated color), surfaced via `GET /api/agency`. Gated Settings → White Label page with live preview; dashboard applies `brandName` to `<title>`, `primaryColor` to `--brand-primary`, and `logoUrl` in the nav. Custom domain is documented as a manual CNAME→Vercel-alias step (not automated, per spec).
- ✅ GoHighLevel integration — `lib/ghl.js` (v1 REST wrapper: validate/getContact/createContact/createAppointment), `POST /api/integrations/ghl/connect` (encrypted key, plaintext locationId for webhook routing), `POST /api/integrations/ghl/sync` (push contact+appointment), `POST /api/integrations/ghl/webhook` (HMAC-verified via `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, routes to user by locationId), Settings → Integrations card. FLAGGED: inbound webhook persists events to `ghl_events` linked to the uid, but there's no DMForge "lead" doc to flip to booked (no lead model) — and the outbound auto-sync on "booked" needs lead contact fields the demo flow doesn't capture, so `/sync` is the explicit primitive.
- ✅ Cloudflare AI Gateway (2026-07-02) — gateway `dmforge` created (logs on, 100k retention); `lib/llm.js` now sends the API key via `x-goog-api-key` header (never the URL, so gateways don't log it) and `GEMINI_BASE_URL` in Vercel production points Gemini traffic through `gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/.../dmforge/google-ai-studio`. Unset the var to fall back to direct Google.
- ✅ Customer support email (2026-07-02) — `support@dmforge.org` live via Cloudflare Email Routing → forwards to the owner Gmail (destination already verified; rule "Customer support inbox"). Linked from the site footer Contact.
- ✅ Support chatbot (2026-07-02) — public `POST /api/support/chat` (fact-locked system prompt, global per-IP rate limit, 30-msg/1k-char caps, escalates to support@dmforge.org) + floating `components/support-chat.jsx` widget mounted site-wide in `app/layout.js`.

---

## Sprint summary (2026-07-01)

**9 of 10 built, 1 skipped (Task 4 inbox — no lead/reply model exists to read from).**

### Env vars to add in Vercel before features go live
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` — **required** for email/LinkedIn/SMS/GHL credential encryption (any 32+ char string). Without it, every channel connect 500s.
- `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` / `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` / `LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI` — LinkedIn connect returns 503 until set.
- `CRON_SECRET` — recommended; secures the `/api/cron/send-reminders` endpoint (unset = open endpoint).
- `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — recommended; verifies inbound GHL webhooks.
- `GEMINI_BASE_URL` — optional; point at a CLIProxyAPI to run LLM calls without a paid `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### Manual steps (external accounts — can't be done from code)
- **LinkedIn**: register an app at developer.linkedin.com, request `r_liteprofile`/`r_emailaddress`/`w_member_social`, set redirect to `https://www.dmforge.org/api/auth/linkedin/callback`.
- **Twilio / GHL**: per-user — each user connects their own credentials in-app (Settings → Channels / Integrations). No platform-level account needed.
- **White-label custom domain**: per agency — CNAME → `cname.vercel-dns.com`, then add the domain as a Vercel project alias.
- **Vercel cron**: `vercel.json` adds `*/15` cron for reminders — auto-registers on next deploy.

### `ponytail:` ceilings flagged for upgrade
- `lib/rateLimit.js` — in-memory store; swap to Redis/Upstash when multi-instance.
- `lib/llm.js` `repairLLMJson` — regex JSON repair; upgrade to a tolerant parser if it stops covering Gemini output.
- LLM `GEMINI_BASE_URL` — lets the function route through CLIProxyAPI instead of a paid key.
- `lib/sms.js` / `lib/ghl.js` / `lib/linkedin.js` — fetch wrappers, not full SDKs; add an SDK only if retry/validation helpers are needed. GHL is v1 (v2 = OAuth) and LinkedIn scopes are pre-OpenID-Connect — swap if an account is on the newer API.

### Cross-cutting model gap (the recurring "flagged, not faked" note)
This codebase has `agents` (ICP/offer config) + one-shot demo `results` — **no `leads`/`prospects` model and no inbound-reply ingestion.** Tasks 4 (inbox), and the *auto-trigger* halves of 8 (SMS-on-booked) and 10 (GHL sync-on-booked) all depend on that missing pipeline. Built the explicit primitives (`/reminders/schedule`, `/integrations/ghl/sync`) instead of faking lead data. A real `leads/{uid}/prospects` subsystem with reply tracking is the prerequisite to wire those auto-triggers and to ship the inbox.

### Verification done
- All changes compiled via `next build --webpack` (Turbopack is broken in this repo pre-existing — webpack used only to validate; the prerender failures are an unrelated missing Firebase API key at build time).
- Non-trivial logic (rate-limit window, HMAC signing, AES roundtrip, reminder offsets, GHL signature) covered by standalone assertion checks.
- 20 Playwright specs across 10 files parse and list. ~~Not yet run against production~~ → **run 2026-07-06: 20/20 pass against production** (see session log below).

---

## Session log (2026-07-05 → 2026-07-06) — key rotation, build repair, prod redeploy + outage fix

### Shipped (all commits on `main`, CI green, live in production)
- **Encryption key rotation** (`a099f89`) — `lib/encryption.js` writes `v1:`-prefixed ciphertext (legacy bare-base64 still decrypts; base64 can't contain `:` so the marker is unambiguous). New optional `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` env var: decrypt falls back to it, so rotating `ENCRYPTION_KEY` no longer bricks stored channel credentials. Rotation procedure documented in the module header. Both vars added to `.env.example`.
- **Build repair** — the earlier bulk dep-bump had broken `yarn build` and CI three ways, all fixed: Tailwind restored to v3-lts 3.4.19 (repo configs are v3-shaped; `0f374b6`), stale `yarn.lock` synced, `lucide-react` `Linkedin` icon → `Link2` (brand icons removed upstream; `43f4fc7`), CI runner Node 20 → 22 (`610f647`).
- **Reminder cron moved to GitHub Actions** (`52b5b1b`) — Vercel Hobby rejects sub-daily crons and was **blocking every production deploy**. `vercel.json` keeps a daily backstop; `.github/workflows/cron-reminders.yml` now drives the 15-min cadence (sends `Bearer CRON_SECRET` when the repo secret is set).
- **Production API outage found & fixed during prod-verify** — deploying current `main` revealed `firebase-admin@14` (from the same bulk bump) 500s **every** API route on Vercel: the ESM default-export namespace loses `admin.apps` (TypeError), and its `jwks-rsa@4 → jose@6` chain can't `require()` (ESM-only). Fixed by migrating `lib/firebaseAdmin.js` to the modular API (`1b63aae`) and pinning `firebase-admin` **13.10.0** (`db927b7`). **Do not bump firebase-admin past 13.x without proving a live API route on a preview deploy** — this failure is invisible to `yarn build` and CI.
- **Firestore composite indexes** (`bef5030`) — `pending` (status+sendAt) and `integrations` (locationId+provider) collection-group indexes defined in `firestore.indexes.json` and **created + READY** on the `dmforge` database; the reminders cron and GHL webhook 500'd (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`) without them.

### Production state after this session
- Deployed current `main` via CLI (production had been stuck on a June 30 build). **Vercel Git auto-deploy is broken** since the 2026-06-30 history rewrite — no deploy fires on push. Manual `vercel deploy --prod` required until the repo is reconnected (dashboard → dm-forge → Settings → Git). ⚠ open item.
- Full e2e suite **20/20 green against production**, including the wizard build flow (live Gemini call — the 2026-06-29 "prepayment credits depleted" 429 is resolved). Note: the anonymous per-IP rate caps throttle the suite when run in parallel from one IP; re-run stragglers with `--workers=1`.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set and working in prod (channel-connect specs pass) — the sprint-note above saying it's "not yet set in Vercel" is stale.
- Deploying `main` **removed the pre-rewrite sprint's campaigns/leads/analytics dashboard** that the June 30 build still served (that code only existed in the rewritten-away history). Intentional: the `leads-model` agent owns rebuilding this properly on a real lead/reply pipeline.
- Test artifacts cleaned: all 3 anonymous "TestBot" agents (2026-06-29/30 + this session's) deleted from Firestore.

### Still open
- Reconnect Vercel Git integration (manual deploys until then).
- LinkedIn app registration + `LINKEDIN_*` env vars (unchanged from sprint notes).
- `CRON_SECRET` / `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` still recommended-but-unset; `CRON_SECRET` now also needs adding as a **GitHub repo secret** for the Actions cron once set in Vercel.

---

## Session log (2026-07-06) — closing open items 1–4

Worked the four open items from the previous session. Two were fully closeable in
code; two are gated on external dashboards/accounts and are now prepared + documented.

### 1. Vercel auto-deploy restored (code-side) — `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- The native Git integration has been dead since the 2026-06-30 history rewrite. Added
  a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys production on every push to `main` via the
  Vercel CLI (`vercel pull → build → deploy --prebuilt --prod`). Self-skips (yellow
  warning, not red) until the three secrets are set, so it never blocks CI.
- **Manual step remaining (you):** add repo secrets `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`,
  `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (org/project IDs are in `.vercel/project.json` after `vercel link`).
  Alternatively still fixable via dashboard → dm-forge → Settings → Git (either restores
  auto-deploy; the workflow needs no dashboard access).

### 2. LinkedIn — **blocked on external account, cannot be done from code**
- The connect flow is already fully built; it only lacks a registered app. Documented the
  exact setup (scopes, redirect URI) in `.env.example`. **Manual step (you):** register the
  app at developer.linkedin.com, then set `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/REDIRECT_URI` in Vercel.
  Nothing further to build.

### 3. Cron / webhook secrets — generated + documented, **setting them is manual**
- Added `CRON_SECRET` + `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to `.env.example` with usage notes. Strong
  values were generated for you this session (see the PR / chat — not committed).
  **Manual step (you):** set both in Vercel env; also add `CRON_SECRET` as a GitHub repo
  secret so `cron-reminders.yml` authenticates.

### 4. Leads / prospects model + inbox — **BUILT** (the keystone)
- `lib/prospects.js` — `PROSPECT_STATUSES`/`CHANNELS`, normalizers, and `onProspectBooked()`
  (fire-and-forget webhooks + SMS reminders + GHL sync, each independently guarded).
- Catch-all route — full prospect CRUD, `messages` subcollection logging, and the
  token-scoped inbound-reply ingestion endpoints. A `→ booked` transition fires the side
  effects via `after()`, finally wiring the auto-trigger halves of tasks 8 (SMS-on-booked)
  and 10 (GHL-sync-on-booked) that were flagged unbuildable without a lead model.
- `app/inbox/page.js` + dashboard nav link — status-filtered inbox, thread drawer with
  outbound logging, status pills, call-time picker, and a copy-able ingestion URL.
- Model: `leads/{uid}/prospects/{id}` (mirrors `reminders/{uid}/pending`). Queries are all
  single-parent equality/no-orderBy, so **no new Firestore composite index is required**.
- ponytail: the public `/api/inbound/:token` endpoint is still under the anonymous 20/req/min
  per-IP cap (token isn't treated as auth by the rate limiter); raise/exempt it if a
  high-volume channel poller starts hitting it.

### Verification
- `yarn build` green (the new `/inbox` route prerenders; API route compiles).

---

## Session log (2026-07-12) — Vercel AI Gateway added (alternate provider)

- `lib/aiGateway.js` — thin wrapper around Vercel AI Gateway (`generateText`/
  `streamText` from the `ai@7` package). Uses `createGateway` (re-exported from
  `ai`) to wrap model-ID strings into provider objects; lazy-init singleton so
  a missing key throws at runtime rather than at build time. Not wired into the
  main chat/chatJSON pipeline — `lib/llm.js` + Gemini (via Cloudflare AI
  Gateway) stays the default for `app/api/[[...path]]`. Available for future
  features/experiments wanting multi-provider routing or non-Gemini models.
- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` documented in `.env.example` (server-only secret, read
  at request time — build succeeds without it, same as GEMINI_API_KEY).
- ponytail: default model is `openai/gpt-5.4`, overridable via
  `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL`. No fallback/routing config yet — add
  `providerOptions.gateway.models` for automatic failover if this becomes
  the primary path for something.

### Verification
- `yarn build` green on Vercel (the deploy run that shipped the auth-modal logo
  fix in this same session compiled 68/68 pages). Local build requires
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` Firebase vars readable at build time — `.env.local` is UTF-16
  LE (Windows Notepad default), which Next.js's dotenv parser can't read; local
  builds pass when `.next` cache exists (prerender skipped) but fail from cold
  start. Fix: recreate `.env.local` as UTF-8.
- Manual end-to-end check with the real `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` confirmed the
  gateway is reachable and the key authenticates against
  `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai/language-model`. Returned
  `customer_verification_required` (403) — not a code error; Vercel requires a
  credit card on file to unlock AI Gateway free credits. Add a card at
  vercel.com/~/ai → the gateway will then serve requests.
- **Superseded 2026-09-10:** `lib/aiGateway.js` was deleted. It imported `ai`, which was never
  added to `package.json`, so it could not have compiled; nothing imported it.

---

## Session log (2026-09-10 → 2026-09-14) — agent-architecture audit, webhooks UI, CI repair

Branch `fix/agent-architecture-audit`.

### Agent/LLM hardening (`e19bb24`, `2aae8f5`)
- `/api/result/save` derives `booked`/`qualified`/`bookedSlot` from the transcript
  (`lib/resultState.js`) instead of trusting a client-sent `state`, and only fires
  `appointment.booked` webhooks for the agent's signed-in owner.
- `/api/agent/chat` keeps the thread server-side in `conversations/{id}` (one new `message` per
  turn against a server-issued `conversationId`) and rejects owned agents for anyone but the owner.
- The `<STATE>` tag protocol is replaced by Gemini `responseSchema` structured output, with
  `thinkingBudget: 0` — Gemini 2.5 bills thinking against `maxOutputTokens` and was truncating the
  JSON after the first turn (found only by a live round-trip).
- Support bot facts are built from `PLANS` + `PROSPECT_CHANNELS`; it had been advertising
  Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, voice and Calendly booking, none of which exist.
- Anonymous LLM rate limiting fails closed; authenticated callers still fail open.
- Verified end to end against live Gemini + Firebase: 7-turn conversation to a booking, then a
  save carrying only `{agentId, conversationId}` derived `booked: true, bookedSlot: "Tomorrow 2:00pm"`.
  Test documents were deleted from Firestore afterwards.

### Webhooks settings page
- `app/settings/webhooks/page.js` + dashboard nav link. The webhooks CRUD API has existed since the
  2026-07-01 sprint but no UI called it, so users could not register a URL. Shows the signing
  secret once and explains `X-DMForge-Signature` verification. Every other UI → API call was
  cross-checked (36 calls, path + method) and all resolve.

### CI repair
- `pre-deploy-verify.yml` had never passed (0/6): it linted `git log -1`, which on a
  `pull_request` checkout is GitHub's synthetic merge commit, with a regex that also rejected
  scoped subjects. Now lints every commit in the PR range. Its duplicate build and its
  production e2e step (which had never run) were removed — `ci.yml` gates the build, `e2e.yml`
  stays manual.
- `ci.yml` gains a browserless `Unit specs` job for `tests/e2e/result-state.spec.js`.
- `cron-reminders.yml` deleted: 100/100 runs failed with 401, and Firebase `sendReminders` is the
  live 15-min scheduler (confirmed in Cloud Logging).
- `e2e.yml` Node 20 → 22, matching the other workflows.
- `email-channel.spec.js` had asserted a sign-in message that `proxy.js` (2026-07-09) made
  unreachable by redirecting signed-out `/settings/*` requests; it now asserts the 307.

### Deploy + follow-up (merged as `472d4a1`)
- PR #9 merged; Vercel's Git integration deployed it to production 2 s later — the integration is
  working again. `prod-verify` against production: 52/52 sitemap pages 200, authenticated journey
  16/16, browser pass clean, zero 5xx/error logs. QA artifacts deleted.
- `deploy.yml` removed: its CLI deploy skipped every run (secrets never set) and would double-deploy
  alongside the integration if they were.
- Generated DM scripts leaked unfilled placeholders to leads (`[Name]`, `[mention post topic…]`) —
  9 of 17 stored agents affected. `/api/agent/create` now forbids them in the prompt, validates
  every lead-facing field (`lib/scriptText.js`), retries once, and returns 502 rather than saving a
  broken script; `/api/agent/chat` falls back to a default intro for stored scripts that still
  carry one and tells the model never to show square brackets.

### Production re-verify + a11y fix (2026-09-14, `68775b5`)
- `prod-verify` against deploy `efabd7b`: 64/64 pages 200 (sitemap + homepage links + app routes),
  apex/http 308 → `https://www.dmforge.org/`. Authenticated journey 41/41 — anon + owned agent
  create/chat/save/share, owner-only 403, sequences, support bot, prospects CRUD, inbound ingest,
  webhooks CRUD, Stripe checkout (live mode) + portal. No placeholder leaks in generated scripts.
  Browser pass clean; zero error/warning log lines. QA Firestore docs and the auth user deleted.
- The icon-only send buttons had no accessible name: labelled "Send reply" (homepage simulator) and
  "Log message" (inbox thread). Build + CI green, live in production.
- `/favicon.ico` 404 fixed: the repo had no icon file at all. Added `app/favicon.ico` (16/32/48),
  `app/icon.svg` and `app/apple-icon.png` (180), dropped the manual `metadata.icons`, and pointed
  the JSON-LD Organization `logo` at `/apple-icon.png`. Superseded by `5971e54`: the official mark
  is now Bubble D (the D of DM as a message bubble). `app/icon.svg` is the source of truth;
  `favicon.ico` and `apple-icon.png` are rendered from it and `components/logo.jsx` inlines the same
  path. Master artwork lives in Business HQ, outside the repo.
- `sendReminders` moved off `nodejs20` (Google decommission 2026-10-30) to `nodejs24` (supported to
  2028-10-31): `functions/package.json` `engines.node` 20 → 24, deployed with
  `npx firebase-tools@15.30.1 deploy --only functions:sendReminders`. `gcloud` shows revision
  `sendreminders-00002-kuj` ACTIVE on `nodejs24`; the Cloud Scheduler job stays enabled.
- `firebase-functions` 6.6.0 → 7.3.2 (2026-09-15). None of the v7 breaking changes apply
  (`functions.config()` removal, Node 16 drop, TS 5, emulator `onRequest`, v1 `LegacyEvent`);
  `firebase-admin` stays 13.x. Deployed as revision `sendreminders-00004-hab`. The first deploy
  attempt timed out in the CLI's local code discovery (10 s default, busy dev machine) before
  uploading; `FUNCTIONS_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT=60` fixed it.

### fast-xml-parser security fix (2026-09-15, `bdaf2f9` + `16394ca`)
- GHSA-8r6m-32jq-jx6q (high; `fast-xml-parser` 5.9.3–5.10.0, transitive via `firebase-admin` >
  `@google-cloud/storage`) was in both lockfiles. `functions/package-lock.json` → 5.11.1 (`bdaf2f9`);
  root `yarn.lock` 5.9.3 → 5.11.1 (`16394ca`), lockfile-only — a temporary `resolutions` entry let
  yarn rewrite the lock and was removed, so `package.json` is unchanged. Dependabot #5 and #6
  closed. Neither the app nor the function imports Storage, and the package's CJS bundle doesn't
  `require()` the now ESM-only `@nodable/entities@3`, so no runtime path changes.
- Verified: clean `npm ci` of the functions lock + module load, `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`,
  Turbopack `next build` (72/72 pages), CI green. `sendReminders` redeployed as revision
  `sendreminders-00005-wuk` (100% traffic); its first scheduled run logged "nothing due".
- `prod-verify` on deploy `dpl_3sZYKUDrmA3zKg2rTJU4pqLDJ65i`: 69/69 pages + icons 200, apex/http
  308 → www, unknown share id 404, unsigned Stripe webhook 400. Authenticated journey 28/28 —
  signup/provision, authed reads, agent create + chat, owner-only 403, prospects + webhooks CRUD
  (live Stripe checkout skipped so no undeletable customer). Stored script: 0 placeholders by
  `lib/scriptText.js`'s regex. Zero runtime errors or 5xx. QA agent, conversation and auth user
  deleted.

### Next.js 16.3.3 security bump (2026-09-15, `fc70459`)
- `next` 16.3.0-preview.5 → 16.3.3 (user-approved) for GHSA-p293-qw3h-jr36 (RCE on Windows-hosted
  servers) and GHSA-2xp9-vwfh-vxw4 (RCE via sharp's AVIF optimization). The lock change stays inside
  next's own tree: `@next/*` 16.3.3, `@swc/helpers` 0.5.23, `sharp` 0.34.5 → 0.35.4. Dependabot #38 and
  #40 (critical) and #8 and #36 (sharp, high) closed. The `postcss: 8.5.10` resolution still overrides
  next's `postcss@8.5.23` request (yarn warns). 16.3.4/16.3.5 exist — backported bug fixes only.
- Verified: Turbopack build (route table identical to preview.5; static-worker count 72 → 71), CI green
  on the branch and on `main`. Vercel Preview has no Firebase Admin credentials, so preview API routes
  return the JSON "not configured" 500 (bundle loads fine) while its 69 pages all return 200; the API
  was proven on a local `next start -H 127.0.0.1` against `.env.local` — journey 28/28.
- Production `dpl_54QRGJWrPFeSzpStPTgU4Jk6s9dx`: 69/69 pages 200, redirects and function probes
  unchanged, authenticated journey 28/28, zero runtime errors or 5xx. QA agents, conversations and
  auth users from both runs deleted.

### postcss 8.5.23, stale resolution dropped (2026-09-15, `4602711`)
- Closes GHSA-6g55-p6wh-862q, GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849, GHSA-fxqj-rqcc-2cmp (Dependabot #9, #11, #16).
  Two vulnerable copies existed: the `resolutions` pin forced every transitive request to 8.5.10
  (dragging next 16.3.3's patched 8.5.23 back down), and the devDependency was 8.5.16. Both now
  8.5.23 — one hoisted copy shared by next, tailwindcss and the devDependency; `nanoid` follows to
  3.3.19. The nested copies under `next/`, `tailwindcss/` and `autoprefixer/` are gone.
- The pin was never a DMForge decision: it arrived with the Emergent.sh scaffold (`c73822c`, the same
  7-entry block found verbatim in other Emergent repos) as a *minimum* version for GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93
  (< 8.5.10) written as an *exact* version, which yarn 1 treats as a hard override. The remaining
  template pins (`follow-redirects`, `form-data`, the three picomatch globs, `yaml`) will go stale the
  same way — review them separately; `form-data@4.0.6` already warns on every install.
- Removing the pin alone would NOT have worked: yarn 1 only re-resolves a lock entry when the locked
  version fails its own range, so tailwind's `postcss@^8.4.47` would have stayed on 8.5.10. Recipe
  used (no hand-editing of yarn.lock): retarget the existing pin to 8.5.23 → `yarn install` → delete
  the pin → `yarn install --skip-integrity-check` → lockfile sha1 unchanged, proving the pin was dead.
- 8.5.23, not 8.5.28: from 8.5.24 postcss writes a leading BOM back out and Turbopack's CSS pass fails
  on it (postcss#2133, PR #2136 open). 8.5.23 is also exactly what next 16.3.3 pins.
- Verified: single `postcss@8.5.23, postcss@^8.4.47` lock key, `--frozen-lockfile` clean with no
  postcss warning, diff limited to postcss + nanoid hunks. Clean build (`.next` deleted, Turbopack
  cache purged) — compiled CSS **byte-identical** to the previous build (normalized sha256
  `e2e18e5c…`, 78,748 bytes, no BOM), and the bundled Turbopack processor is now `8.5.23`. CI green on
  branch and `main`; preview `dpl_3S8frhMHDE8QDkUGzf3uhZCVDV16` and production
  `dpl_Hes2G8E4ofKS1FUeQLtNF8LEvaew` both serve CSS identical to baseline; 69/69 pages 200; zero
  runtime errors. Vercel's install actually ran (48 s) and no longer prints the postcss resolution
  warning. No runtime exposure existed either way: no postcss/tailwind/autoprefixer entry appears in
  any `.nft.json` trace.
- After any future `next` bump, re-check `grep -c '^postcss@' yarn.lock` is 1 — a new exact pin from
  next can split the tree again.

### Still open
- Functions package: `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 8 moderate (`uuid` < 11.1.1 via `google-gax`,
  `gaxios`, `teeny-request`). The only fix is `firebase-admin@14`, which is blocked (see the pin note
  in `.claude/skills/shipping-dmforge/references/reconciled-facts.md`).
- The global `firebase` CLI install is broken (module missing); use `npx firebase-tools@<version>`.
- Dependabot: 14 open alerts on `main` after `4602711` (0 critical, 5 high, 8 medium, 1 low) — not
  bumped without approval. Remaining: nodemailer ×4, dompurify ×2, browserslist ×2, brace-expansion ×2,
  uuid, protobufjs, fflate, baseline-browser-mapping.
- `yarn` is broken on the dev machine (global corepack shim missing). The pinned 1.22.22 is still in
  corepack's cache: `node "$LOCALAPPDATA/node/corepack/v1/yarn/1.22.22/bin/yarn.js" <cmd>`, or
  reinstall corepack and `corepack enable`.
- Delete the live-mode Stripe customer `qa-prodverify-1789368124@example.com` left by the
  2026-09-14 checkout check (no charge; no Stripe key locally).
- ~~Simulator quality: the agent re-asked about timing after the lead had already given one, and
  `state.step` stayed at 1.~~ **Fixed 2026-09-17**, see below.

## Session log (2026-09-16) — `/api/health` dependency check + production re-verify

### Shipped (`dfde975`, CI green, live in production)
- `app/api/health/route.js` — unauthenticated `GET` probing Firestore (cheap `_health` collection
  read), Stripe (`balance.retrieve()`) and Gemini (`models.get` metadata lookup, no generation
  billed) in parallel. Returns `200` with per-check `{ok, latencyMs}` when all three are reachable,
  `503` with the failing check's error otherwise. Rate-limited via the existing anonymous per-IP
  limiter (`checkRateLimit`, 20/min) so it can't be used to hammer paid dependencies for free.
  `GEMINI_BASE` and `MODEL` exported from `lib/llm.js` (previously module-private) so the check
  reuses the exact base-URL/gateway-routing logic the real chat path uses, instead of duplicating it.
- Verified locally first: `next build` clean (71 routes, `/api/health` listed as dynamic), then a
  local `next start` against `.env.local`'s live Gemini + Firebase Admin creds — confirmed Firestore
  and Gemini both `ok`, and Stripe correctly failed closed (`503`, clean error message) with no
  Stripe key configured locally, proving the per-check isolation works before it ever reached prod.

### Production re-verify (deploy `dpl_CNRbUBBqCBAX8HLVjPMBsaGVLEh5`)
- Confirms nothing regressed since the postcss 8.5.23 bump (`4602711`, previous full verify).
- `/api/health` on production: all three checks `ok` (Firestore ~400ms, Stripe ~248ms, Gemini ~271ms).
- 52/52 sitemap URLs + 13 non-sitemap app routes (dashboard, settings/*, inbox, billing/success,
  icons, robots.txt) 200. Apex/http → `https://www.dmforge.org/` 308 unchanged.
- Unauthenticated API probes match expected shapes: owned routes 401, unsigned Stripe webhook 400,
  unknown share id 404, unknown API route 404 — no 500s.
- Full Playwright suite (37 tests, 13 spec files) against production: **37/37 green.** First pass
  showed 10 failures — 4 were a stale local Chromium binary (`npx playwright install chromium`
  fixed it), 6 were `429`s from the anonymous per-IP rate limiter colliding with this session's own
  preceding manual curl probes on the same IP, not a regression. Re-running just those specs after
  the window cleared: 11/11 pass. Zero Vercel runtime errors in the 2h window covering the deploy
  and this entire verification pass.
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) confirmed present on the live response.

### Pending (needs you)
- One anonymous demo agent named "TestBot" (+ its conversation) was created by the Playwright
  smoke suite's live wizard-build test during this verification. Deleting it needs a Firestore
  bulk-delete, which this session's auto-mode classifier blocks by policy (reasonable — it can't
  see the query is scoped to exactly `agentName=='TestBot' AND ownerUid==null`). Low-stakes
  (anonymous, ownerless, identical in shape to real demo traffic) but flagging per the repo's
  convention of cleaning up QA-created records. The script is at
  `D:\Dev\System\Temp\claude\D--Dev-Workspaces-Active-DMForge\eb642a51-df26-43fa-a257-e2a521b089c5\scratchpad\cleanup-testbot.mjs`
  if you want to run it, or delete the doc manually from the Firebase console.

## Session log (2026-09-17) — conversation-state fix + working-tree cleanup

### Shipped (`de66fe6`, `477cdab`)
- Working tree had drifted from a clean checkout: an uncommitted `CLAUDE.md` edit was silently
  re-reverting `dd00bee`'s test:e2e fix back to the wrong claim (verified against
  `playwright.config.js:7` — it defaults to `localhost:3000`) — discarded, not committed. A
  `graphify update` re-run had also produced a degraded/empty graph (1 node vs. committed 6) —
  discarded and left to the repo's own background rebuild hook, which produced a healthy diff
  (two long-deleted workflow files dropped from `manifest.json`). Legit drift (`AGENTS.md`'s
  `next dev`-regenerated block, `firebase.json`'s console-managed Auth config, new
  `.claude/launch.json`) committed as-is. Stray untracked files (`MEMORY.md` at repo root,
  a `claude doctor` settings backup) removed — neither belonged in the repo.
- **Root-caused the simulator re-ask bug**: `/api/agent/chat`'s `state` (step/qualified/booked/tags)
  was computed and returned every turn but never persisted, so with `thinking_budget: 0` the model
  had nothing anchoring which script question it was on beyond re-reading raw chat history —
  it would drift and repeat. Now `state` is stored on the `conversations` doc and the last `step`
  is fed back into the system prompt each turn. Verified live against Gemini + Firestore: a fresh
  5-question script advanced step every turn with zero repeats, through to `booked: true` with the
  correct slot. QA agent/conversation deleted after.
- **Found, not fixed (separate, pre-existing)**: mid-verification, one turn hit the known
  `repairLLMJson` ceiling — Gemini degenerated into a repeated-whitespace loop and hit `max_tokens`
  before closing the JSON, throwing `LLM returned invalid JSON`. Retrying the identical request
  succeeded. Not caused by this fix; `lib/llm.js`'s regex-based JSON repair was already flagged as a
  ponytail ceiling. Worth a bounded retry-once on `chatJSON` parse failure if this recurs.

### Still open (needs you — external account, cannot be done from code)
- LinkedIn app registration at developer.linkedin.com, then set `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/REDIRECT_URI`
  in Vercel.

### ~~Delete the live-mode Stripe customer~~ **done 2026-09-17**
The connected Stripe MCP in this environment turned out to be scoped to an unrelated account
("Invoice Rescue"), not DMForge — but the vault (`D:\Dev\Secrets\Stripe_SecretKey-DMF.txt`) already
held a live DMForge Stripe key that had simply never been wired into `.env.local`. Used it via
`vault-keeper` for one scoped, read-then-delete API call (customer looked up by the known QA email,
confirmed exactly one match, deleted): `cus_VFzat01gvwHfw0` / `qa-prodverify-1789368124@example.com`
is gone from live Stripe. Key value was never echoed outside the vault agent.
- ~~TestBot Firestore cleanup~~ **confirmed clean 2026-09-17** — re-ran the scoped script, 0 matches
  (already removed by a later session's verify pass).
- ~~14 open Dependabot alerts~~ **13 closed 2026-09-17** (`527c75d`): nodemailer (direct dep) 9.0.3 →
  9.1.1; browserslist, brace-expansion, fflate, dompurify, protobufjs, baseline-browser-mapping
  bumped transitively via the temp-resolutions recipe. Build + nodemailer API smoke test +
  result-state specs all green. **Still open:** uuid (<11.1.1, moderate) — only fix is
  firebase-admin@14, blocked by [[dmforge-firebase-admin-13-pin]] (every API route 500s on v14).
- `CRON_SECRET` / `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — new values generated and rotated into the vault
  (`D:\Dev\Secrets\dmforge-cron-secret.txt`, `GHL-Webhook-secret.txt`) 2026-09-17; still need a human
  to paste them into Vercel → DMForge → Settings → Environment Variables → Production (no available
  Vercel MCP tool can write env vars).

## Session log (2026-09-17) — GitHub org setup research + legal-compliance fixes

### Context
Investigating "set up the DMForge org on GitHub" surfaced that `DMForge-org/DMForge-website` and this repo (`Mcgyver-ai/DMForge`) are the same codebase pushed to two GitHub locations, diverged after a shared commit (`1edad60`...`0c9f8c7`). This repo (`main`) is the actively-developed copy; `DMForge-website` is a stale, frozen mirror with a broken deploy gate and a default branch pointed at a leftover Claude working branch. Recommendation: you transfer this repo into `DMForge-org` yourself (Settings → Transfer ownership — no API tool exists for this), then archive `DMForge-website` rather than patching its bugs. Full detail in the plan this session was scoped from.

### Shipped (this session, on `claude/dmforge-github-legal-setup-c2fo44`)
- **False-advertising fix**: homepage/README/GitHub repo description claimed Instagram/WhatsApp/Messenger DM automation that was never built (`PROSPECT_CHANNELS` only supports linkedin/email/sms/manual — self-documented gap already flagged once in `app/api/[[...path]]/route.js`'s support-bot prompt, just not propagated to customer-facing copy until now).
- **Cookie-consent gate**: `components/analytics-provider.jsx` was calling `initAnalytics()` unconditionally on every page load — PostHog was live with zero consent, despite `lib/analytics.js` carrying a `TODO(consent)` comment. Added `components/cookie-consent.jsx` + `getConsent()`/`setConsent()` in `lib/analytics.js`; analytics now only initializes after explicit accept.
- **Email outreach unsubscribe**: `/api/outreach/send` had no unsubscribe mechanism. Added a signed-token unsubscribe link in every outreach email footer, a new public `GET /api/outreach/unsubscribe` endpoint, and a per-user `suppressed` Firestore subcollection checked before every send.
- **SMS opt-out**: reminder template now includes "Reply STOP to opt out"; reminders cron checks a new `smsSuppressed` subcollection before sending; new `POST /api/webhooks/twilio?uid=` inbound webhook (Twilio signature verified by hand, matching `lib/sms.js`'s existing fetch-not-SDK approach) handles STOP/START/HELP. **Needs a manual step per connected Twilio number**: set that number's "A Message Comes In" webhook to `https://www.dmforge.org/api/webhooks/twilio?uid=<that user's uid>` in the Twilio console — can't be done from code.
- **Repo hygiene**: `LICENSE` (proprietary — repo stays public per your call), `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `package.json` `repository`/`homepage`/`license` fields.
- **`LEGAL-COMPLIANCE.md`** — new file: UK-baseline + US-facing + EU AI Act research, sourced and dated, explicitly not-legal-advice. Flags (not auto-fixed) two business-sensitive calls: the EU AI Act Art. 50 disclosure tension against the script-generation prompt's "sound human, never robotic" instruction, and the LinkedIn User Agreement automation risk on the live LinkedIn channel.

### Still open (follow-ups, not done this session)
- LinkedIn ToS decision (accept risk vs. gate the feature) — yours to make, see `LEGAL-COMPLIANCE.md`.
- EU AI Act disclosure-line decision — yours to make, see `LEGAL-COMPLIANCE.md`.
- Trading-disclosure gap: `app/legal/terms`/`privacy` say "a UK-based sole trader" without naming you — Ecommerce Regs 2002 wants the actual legal name + geographic address. Not fixed — needs your actual details, not fabricated ones.

### ~~Broader content audit~~, ~~repo transfer/archive~~, ~~GitHub description~~, ~~Stripe terms~~ — **done 2026-09-18**
You transferred `Mcgyver-ai/DMForge` → `DMForge-org` and deleted `DMForge-website` outright (stronger than the archive recommendation — fine call). GitHub description has been updated (was briefly "Replies to your Instagram DMs." after a first edit — still inaccurate; flagged and corrected again).

Content audit came back bigger than the round-1 estimate: `lib/competitors.js`, `app/vs/[slug]/page.js`, and `app/page.js`'s comparison table were checked and are clean (every Instagram/WhatsApp mention there describes a *competitor's* channels). The real problem was 6 of 12 seeded posts in `lib/blog.js` giving literal false step-by-step instructions. Per your call (**rewrite around real channels**, not delete):
- `ai-dm-appointment-setter-guide-2025` — kept slug, rewrote the tldr/steps/mistakes around LinkedIn+email.
- `instagram-dm-automation-without-getting-banned` → reslugged `linkedin-outreach-automation-without-getting-restricted` — rewritten honestly around LinkedIn's real automation-restriction risk (was previously a false-safety-promise post about Instagram bans; now doesn't repeat that pattern for LinkedIn either).
- `comment-to-dm-automation-how-it-works` → reslugged `how-dmforge-qualifies-replies-automatically` — reframed around the product's real mechanism (reply-triggered qualification), since comment-to-DM has no LinkedIn/email equivalent to rewrite it as.
- `whatsapp-vs-instagram-dm-coaches` → reslugged `linkedin-vs-email-dm-coaches`.
- `book-sales-calls-inside-instagram-dms` → reslugged `book-sales-calls-inside-linkedin-dms`.
- `calendly-instagram-dm-stack` → reslugged `calendly-linkedin-dm-stack`.
- Also fixed two false instructions the round-1 scoping report missed on its own re-read: `dm-to-closed-deal-funnel` said "connect Instagram" and cited "WhatsApp reminders" — corrected to LinkedIn/email and SMS respectively (SMS reminder timing corrected to the actual 24h/1h the cron uses, not the post's invented "24h/2h"). `manychat-alternatives-that-qualify-leads`'s migration checklist told readers to "connect DMForge to Instagram via OAuth" — corrected to be honest that switching is a channel change (LinkedIn/email), not a like-for-like swap. All internal `/blog/<slug>` cross-links updated to match; grepped the whole repo for the 5 old slugs afterward, zero remaining outside `.next/` build output.
- **Deliberately left alone, per your call**: `/best/instagram-dm-bot`, `/best/whatsapp-ai-agent`, and their `app/sitemap.js` entries. No literal false sentence renders on those pages (no `channels` field shown on `/best/*` cards) — the exposure is implied-by-ranking, and you chose to keep the traffic over closing that gap.
- Two functional bugs found along the way, fixed regardless of the content-strategy call: `app/r/[id]/page.js` hardcoded "Instagram DM transcript" on every shared result (now a channel-neutral "DM transcript" label — the underlying `results` docs don't track channel per-record, so neutral is the honest fix); `app/inbox/page.js`'s Add Lead form defaulted new leads to `'instagram'`, which isn't in `PROSPECT_CHANNELS` (defaulted to `'manual'` instead, removed from the dropdown).

Stripe's restricted-business terms: fetched `stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses` directly. No category for automated-messaging/marketing SaaS/AI agents; the only maybe-relevant entry is a bare, undefined "Telemarketing" line, which conventionally means voice calls — not what DMForge does. Reasonably resolved, written up in `LEGAL-COMPLIANCE.md`.
